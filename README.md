The purpose of this project is to create an upgraded version of Rock paper Scissors.
There are four choices that can be chosen by the user and then the computer will choose their selection at random.
The only thing that is to be imported is the random function.
To run the code, simply run it and then the computer will give a series of prompts for the user to play the game. 
An easy way to run the code is to copy and paste in onlne GDP and it will work just fine.
Other online compilers, or Python itself, should have no trouble running the code after the copy and paste.
It will work fine as long as the parameters are met. 
An example will be if the user chooses a number other than 1-4, it will prompt the user to enter a valid response. 
If a user enters a letter, then it will again say to enter a valid response. 
Anything other than a letter or a number will result in the ending of the game and a restart will be needed.
At the end of each game, the user will be prompted to enter y/n to play again or not. 
Any response other than n, N, no, No will result in the game being played again.
